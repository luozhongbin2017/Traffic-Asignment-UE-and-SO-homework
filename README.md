# Traffic-Asignment-UE-and-SO-homework
Through the impedence function and passing ability given by the problem, solve and plot the user travel function and marginal travel time function.
You can check the orginal problem in problem2.png.

And the UE solution picture is Figure_1.png, SO solution is Figure_11.png.

What's more, the 1_1.png and 2_1.png is to compare the diffences between UE and SO in user travel function from line1 and line2.
